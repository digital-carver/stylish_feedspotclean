This is a [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) theme for [Feedspot](http://www.feedspot.com/), an RSS feed reader. 

The intent here is to put content front and center, and to shave off as much space as possible from other, less useful elements on the page. Almost every change mentions what it does in a comment, so you can comment out or change values as fits you.  
Other than changing widths and heights to save space, this also:

* removes the 'Delete' button that appears when you hover over feed names on the left (are you going to be deleting feeds daily?)

* removes the 'Mark all as read' button at the top - I use only the 'Mark everything above this as read' button the appears between posts, but if you use it often, you can remove the `display: none` line under #ajaxmarkasread.

* removes a few other redundant page elements that are present redundantly and again and again and repeatedly - like the various "Add sites" inputs (leaves a single "Add new site" button at the top left), and the umpteen "Share" buttons. 

Available on userstyles.org [as Feedspot Clean](https://userstyles.org/styles/118032/feedspot-clean) (also has screenshots showing before/after of this style on feedspot).
